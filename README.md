- 👋 Hi, I’m @antennaboy605
- 👀 I’m interested in antenna design, like leaky-wave antenna, millimetr-wave antenna, dielectrical resonator antenna, and computational electromagnetics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning antenna design in mobile terminals, for the purpose of increasing efficiency of antenna radiation, and improving bandwidth of antenna, things like that, due to the limited of space for antenna on mibile devices.
